### The project requirements

Users should be able:

- to move the books from the current shelf on the main page or from the search page to the selected shelf in the book options
- to click add button to move on the search page to add new books, the default book options value for those books is 'none'
- to find the current shelf state for the books which's available on the main page in the search page as well

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- react js

### What I learned

As begginer in using React I learned too much from diving deep with the declertive programming
using map and filter, and this project also helped me a lot to get further in React fundementals faster
through building a reusable components depending on the one parent app component.
