## Overview

This is a completed the 1st project for advanced web dev ND at Udacity (react & redux & webpack)
My Reads App are two pages there's sections describes 3 defferent shelves on the main page
and there's another page to search for a new books and add it to my current shelves in the main page.

### The project requirements

Users should be able to:

- move the books from the current shelf on main page or from search page to the selected shelf
- click to move on search page to add new books, and see the default shelves value for those books is 'none'
- view the options shelf state for the books which's on main page shelves selected if they find in search page
- The search page also has a link to / (the root URL), which leads back to the main page.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- react js

### What I learned

As begginer in using React I learned too much from diving deep with the declertive programming
using map and filter, and this project also helped me a lot to get further in React fundementals faster
through building a reusable components depending on the one parent app component.
